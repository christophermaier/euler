# euler

My answers to [Project Euler][] programming problems, implemented in [Clojure][].

## Usage

This project is build using [Leiningen][], a Clojure build tool.  Once installed, you can execute the tests for all the solutions with these commands (the first two are only necessary the first time):

    lein clean
    lein deps
    lein test
